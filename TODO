== Tasks/Celery ==
* Tasks wrapped within a transaction?
* Reload workers when an update is done on their code: 
  The remote control command pool_restart sends restart requests to the workers child processes. It is particularly useful for forcing the worker to import new modules, or for reloading already imported modules. This command does not interrupt executing tasks.


== Resources ==
* It makes sence to provide support for arbitrary resources per content type?
  i.e. VirtualHost handles apache2 and apache1 daemons and both have different resource needs
* Expressions can match after object.save(): we need to fully generate forms on each __init__
* If in some cases resource values are mandatory the script is responisble for the bussines logic since 
  the only way will be doing object double saving.


== General == 
* Change expression concept to RULE
* Write model validations on validation-py files and reuse them
* Logging more!!


== Human tasks ==
* Rename to jobs?


== Coding style ==
* less coupling     function(contact) <- wrong
                    function(contact.id, contact.date) <- good

== ORM ==
* Group_by: Members.objects.values('designation').annotate(dcount=Count('designation'))
