MySQL is throwing deadlock errors, what can I do?
Answer: MySQL has default isolation level set to REPEATABLE-READ, if you donâ€™t really need that, set it to READ-COMMITTED. You can do that by adding the following to your my.cnf:

[mysqld]
transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED

For more information about InnoDB`s transaction model see MySQL - The InnoDB Transaction Model and Locking in the MySQL user manual.
