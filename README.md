django-orchestra
================

Orchestra is a framework for building web hosting control panels.

Motivation
----------

There are a lot of widely used open source hosting control panels but none of them seems apropiate when you already have a production service infraestructre or simply you want your own architecture.


The goal of this project is provide the tools for easily build a fully featured control panel that fits your service architecture. 


Orchestra is entirely based on reusable applications, so feel free to reuse what you need.


For now the web interface is based on django.contrib.admin, enhaced with admin_tools and fluent_dashboard
